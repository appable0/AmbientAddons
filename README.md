# Kotlin and Essential template for 1.8.9 client-side forge mods

A small template mostly designed for my own learning and potentially future projects. Based on @romangraef's Forge 1.8.9 template.

Note that I am new to Java and Kotlin, and MC modding in general: there very well could be questionable design choices or serious issues. (if you happen to notice any, I'd appreciate a note!) 

Includes an example Vigilance configuration for main settings and PersistentData data class to allow easily de/serializing additional data.
